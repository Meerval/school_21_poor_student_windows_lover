# üêßFor Peers Who Love Windows So Much üíî

This Docker project helps you write code in any Windows IDE and synchronize your changes with a Linux container in real time.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** You may see the username `ashaclem` used in paths and commands. This is a placeholder for a personal login. Replace it with your own username if necessary.

## Getting Started

1. Choose the directory where you want to work on your School 21 projects and download this project into that directory.
2. Download and install [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/), then launch it.
3. Open PowerShell in the project directory and build the Docker image:

    ```ps1
    docker build -t s21 .
    ```

4. Create a container based on the image (think of it as creating a new computer):

    ```ps1
    docker create --name s21 -v "${PWD}:/home/ashaclem/s21" -it s21
    ```

5. Start the container (like powering on your new computer):

    ```ps1
    docker start -ai s21
    ```

    To stop the container, run:
    
    ```ps1
    docker stop s21
    ```

6. Verify the container is running:

    ```ps1
    docker ps
    ```

7. Access the container's terminal:

    ```ps1
    docker exec -it s21 /bin/bash
    ```

    Use `exit` to leave the terminal.

8. Set up SSH keys inside the container. Place your own SSH keys into the `.ssh/` directory of the project, and name them `id_ed25519` and `id_ed25519.pub`.

9. Run `dos2unix.sh` inside the container to convert script files from Windows to Linux line endings (`\r\n` ‚Üí `\n`):

    ```sh
    ./dos2unix.sh
    ```

10. Run `docker_preset.sh` inside the container to install the SSH keys and assign correct permissions to your user:

    ```sh
    ./docker_preset.sh
    ```

## You're Done!

Now, to start working, just start your Docker container and you're good to go.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes, if you add files from the Windows side, you may need to manually reset ownership and permissions inside the container:

```sh
sudo chown -R ashaclem:ashaclem /home/ashaclem/s21
sudo chmod -R u+rwX /home/ashaclem/s21
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Also, if you try to run shell scripts created on Windows, you may need to re-run `dos2unix.sh`, or use this command to fix all relevant files inside the container:

```sh
find . -type f \( -iname "*.sh" -o -iname "*.c" -o -iname "*.h" -o -iname "*.yml" -o -iname "Dockerfile" -o -iname "Makefile" \) -exec dos2unix {} +
```
